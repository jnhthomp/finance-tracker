This application only allows users that have signed up for an account to access the site. Upon account creation users can search for stocks by ticker symbol and add them to their profile.
Users can also search for other users and follow and view their profiles.

For a detailed explanation of how this application works please see the [classNotes repo](https://github.com/jnhthomp/ClassNotes/blob/main/RubyOnRails/Notes2/9-Stock-Tracker-App/classNotes.rb) on [my githb](https://github.com/jnhthomp) starting from '9-Stock-Tracker-App'
This will outline how the project was created, how the database is structured,and how each part of the application works together.

## What I Learned
- Rapid prototyping with rails 'magic'
- Make use of out of the box tools like bootstrap and template generators
- How to use generators to build features and then tailor them as needed
- Install configure and customize 3rd party gems/tools like devise for authentication

## Optimizations
There is currently no testing framework used since this was a 'rapid development' application.
It would be a good idea to add some tests to ensure everything is working properly
